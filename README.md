logKext
=======

An update to fsb's logKext tool. Runs on 10.9 Mavericks!

This only required 2 or 3 trivial changes in the code.

I haven't extensively tested this, but it appears to work completely.

If you've used logKext before, you won't be surprised. It's exactly the same in every way.

For any information, visit the [logKext Wiki](https://code.google.com/p/logkext/w/list).
